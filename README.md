This is a simple implementation of the classic game where you can play against a computer. The game is written in Python and consists of two main files: Player.py and TicTacToe.py

Game Instructions:
The game will display the board with numbers representing each spot.
Players take turns to enter a number (0-8) to place their mark (X or O) on the board.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all spots are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie.
